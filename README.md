# EXP.NO.3 - IMPLEMENTATION OF DELTA MODULATION

##  AIM
To study Delta Modulation using the Delta Modulation Trainer Kit.

---

##  APPARATUS REQUIRED
- Trainer Kit  
- DSO (10 MHz)  
- Patch Cords  
- Power Supply (0-30V)  

---

##  PROCEDURE
1. **Power ON the Trainer Kit**  
   Switch on the Delta Modulation Trainer Kit and ensure all necessary modules are functional.

2. **Connect the Input Signal**  
   Connect the function generator to the input terminal of the trainer kit.  
   Set it to output a low-frequency sine wave (e.g., 1 kHz, 1 Vpp).

3. **Connect Output to CRO**  
   Use BNC cables to connect the modulated output to Channel 1 of the CRO.  
   Connect the demodulated (reconstructed) output to Channel 2 of the CRO.

4. **Observe Modulated Signal**  
   On the oscilloscope, observe the digital Delta Modulated waveform.  
   It should appear as a staircase or two-level binary waveform.

5. **Observe Demodulated Signal**  
   Observe the demodulated waveform on Channel 2.  
   Compare it with the input sine waveform.

6. **Adjust Parameters**  
   Vary the sampling rate and input frequency.  
   Note changes in output waveform.  
   - High input frequency or low sampling rate can cause **slope overload distortion**.

7. **Record Observations**  
   Note down and capture screenshots or sketches of the waveforms from the CRO.
